## The Demo List

### Where can I see this?

**[Check it out here.](https://rowrawer.com/)**

### What is this?

This is a simple list of demos for my GitHub repos as well as some other projects I did. Uses Javascript to make a list from a JSON file. Bundled with Rollup.

### What's the point?

It collects some of the stuff I tinkered with into a neat list + it helped me familiarize myself with Rollup. Also, I wanted it to be tiny.
